-- Table Schema:
-- Table: grinch_mischief_log
--   log_date: DATE
--   mischief_score: INTEGER
--

-- My Solution:

SELECT
    log_date,
    mischief_score,
    mischief_score 
      - LAG(mischief_score) OVER (ORDER BY log_date) 
        AS daily_score_change
FROM grinch_mischief_log
ORDER BY log_date;
